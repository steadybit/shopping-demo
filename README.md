# steadybit Demo Application

## üìù Introduction

We provide a small demo application to give you a quick and easy start into the world of Chaos Engineering.
This demo application is a product catalog consisting of products from three different categories (toys, fashion and hot-deals).

## High Level Architecture

![Architecture](./architecture.jpg)

The shopping demo consists of three backend services per each product category (`bestseller-fashion`, `bestseller-toys` and `hot-deals`).
Each microservice provides a list of products.
These products are aggregated by the `gateway`-microservice and exposed to the user via `shopping-ui`.
In addition, each product microservice uses the `inventory-service` to determine stock availability.

## Technical Architecture

All services are based on Spring Boot and use different Spring projects.

- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- [Spring Cloud](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud)
- [Spring Cloud Gateway](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gateway)

As mentioned above the `gateway` is the entrypoint for the UI.

### Products REST Endpoint

The `gateway` provides available products via the `/products`-endpoint which collects all products from each
microservices (`bestseller-fashion`, `bestseller-toys` and `hot-deals`).
This endpoints is implemented in the [ProductsController](blob/master/gateway/src/main/java/com/steadybit/demo/shopping/gateway/ProductsController.java).
Multiple implementation strategies exists using each different resilience patterns: fallbacks, timeouts and circuit breakers as described subsequently.

There are multiple endpoints available to demonstrate different implementations.
